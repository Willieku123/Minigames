# MINIGAMES
This repository includes all of my terminal style games. \
Most of the games here are developed when I was new to programming(still a newbie now tho), so the codes are really messy
### TETRIS (Python)
Runnable but a bit buggy bc it's my first time to program something
### 20 EXPRESS (Python)

### OLD MAID (C++)
Sadly the source code is gone, but I found the EXE in the trash can.
Trust me it's not a virus
